### Hi! I'm Kieron

🧑‍💻 I'm a professional software engineer who occasionally dabbles in side projects, from web apps to video games.

🧑‍💼 I work for [Odin](https://joinodin.com/) as a software engineer, where we're on a mission to enable everyone to vote with their money on what the future looks like, and participate in creating it.

🛠 My main languages are Go and Typescript, but I'm not religous about either - I prefer to focus on getting stuff done.

⭐ Author and maintainer of [supabase-community/gotrue-go](https://github.com/supabase-community/gotrue-go).

✨ My most interesting projects are probably https://trail-tracker.vercel.app or anything on https://kwoodhouse.itch.io/.

🎢 I co-founded a failing SaaS startup once - check out [Influent](https://influent.digital/).
