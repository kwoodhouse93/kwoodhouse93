### Hi! I'm Kieron

🧑‍💻 I'm a professional software engineer who occasionally dabbles in side projects, from web apps to video games.

🎢 I've co-founded a failing SaaS startup once - check out [Influent](influent.com).

🧑‍💼 I work for [Odin](joinodin.com) as a software engineer, where we're on a mission to drive progress, by creating a radically better way for people to connect, collaborate and invest together.

🛠 My main languages are Go and Typescript, but I'm not religous about either - I prefer to focus on getting stuff done.

✨ My most interesting projects are probably https://trail-tracker.vercel.app or anything on https://kwoodhouse.itch.io/

📝 I like to write, too - mostly about my work, plus the odd foray into creative writing.

👀 To see more of my stuff, [check out my website](https://kwoodhouse.co.uk/), or [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/k_woodhouse93) for more direct access to my brain.
