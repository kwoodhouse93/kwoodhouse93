### Hi! I'm Kieron

🧑‍💻 I'm a professional software engineer who occasionally dabbles in side projects, building whatever takes my fancy, from web apps to video games

🎢 I've also ridden the rollercoaster of co-founding a failing SaaS startup once. It turns out sales and marketing are really important&mldr;

🧑‍💼 These days, I mainly focus on freelance, consulting and contract work through [@exact-tech](https://github.com/exact-tech)

### Do you have a project you think I can help with?

📫 Drop me an email at kieron@exacttech.co.uk to discuss it!

---

🛠 My main languages are Go and Typescript, but I'm not religous about either - I like to take a pragmatic approach to getting stuff done

✨ My most interesting projects are probably https://trail-tracker.vercel.app or anything on https://kwoodhouse.itch.io/

📝 I like to write, too - mostly about my work, plus the odd foray into creative writing.

👀 To see more of my stuff, [check out my website](https://kwoodhouse.co.uk/), or [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/k_woodhouse93) for more direct access to my brain
